Max patches created by Hasan Hujairi. 

1. Monome Sequencer
As suggested by the title, this is a sequencer I created for the 128-button Monome. 
The scale used in this sequencer is a Middle Eastern maqam (mode) called Huzam. 
I did this by creating a coll list of frequencies as listed by the scala tuning tool. 
This is a very rough max patch and it attempts to explore the possibilities of sequencing in non-Western/microtonal modes.

Enjoy.
